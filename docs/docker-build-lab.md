# Lab 6 – Build automation and Docker image builds

Report for Applied DevOps Lab 6, Tasks 0–7. Task 8 (containerizing the project) is documented separately in [`docs/docker-build.md`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/hospital-devops/blob/main/docs/docker-build.md) of the `hospital-devops` repository.

- Demo repository: <https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo>
- Author: Cecília Galvão (GitHub: `ceciliagalvaoo`)

All links in this report are absolute so that they keep working when the file is copied to another repository. Every command output shown here was captured from a real run; anything that was skipped or failed is stated explicitly.

## Task 0 – Preparation

### Repository

A new **public** repository `docker-build-demo` was created on GitHub and cloned to `C:\Users\Inteli\Documents\GitHub\docker-build-demo` (accessed from WSL as `/mnt/c/Users/Inteli/Documents/GitHub/docker-build-demo`). It is completely separate from the project repository.

```text
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo.git (push)

$ gh repo view ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo --json name,visibility,isEmpty
{"isEmpty":true,"name":"docker-build-demo","visibility":"PUBLIC"}      # before the first commit

$ git log --oneline -1
0a94fbe chore: initial commit                                          # empty initial commit on main
```

Workflow (same as Lab 5): one branch per task (`task-0-preparation`, `task-1-...`, …), a pull request into `main`, then a merge.

### Environment

| Component | Where | Version / result |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| OS | WSL2 | Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (kernel 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2) on Windows |
| Docker | WSL2 (Docker Engine, **no Docker Desktop**) | Client 28.5.1, Engine 28.5.1, API 1.51, containerd v1.7.28, runc 1.3.0 |
| BuildKit | WSL2 | buildx v0.29.1; builder `default` (driver `docker`) running BuildKit v0.25.1, platforms `linux/amd64 (+3), linux/386` |
| .NET SDK | WSL2 | 10.0.403 (installed during Task 0, see below) |
| JDK | WSL2 | OpenJDK 21.0.12.1 (`javac 21.0.12.1`) |
| Maven | – | not installed globally (not needed; the project uses the Maven wrapper `mvnw`) |
| GitHub CLI | WSL2 | gh 2.102.0, logged in as `ceciliagalvaoo` |
| Git | Windows | 2.52.0.windows.1, `core.autocrlf=true` (system config) |

Docker check:

```text
$ docker version            # Client 28.5.1 / Server 28.5.1 (see table)
$ docker run --rm hello-world
Hello from Docker!
...
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE       DRIVER/ENDPOINT   STATUS    BUILDKIT   PLATFORMS
default*        docker
 \_ default      \_ default       running   v0.25.1    linux/amd64 (+3), linux/386
desktop-linux                     error
```

The `desktop-linux` builder/context is a leftover of a former Docker Desktop installation and is not used. All Docker commands in this lab run against the Docker Engine inside WSL2 (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock`).

### Missing SDK and how it was resolved

At the start, the **.NET SDK 10 was missing**: WSL had no `dotnet`, and Windows only had SDK 9.0.306. The lab allows three alternatives (install locally, use a Codespace, or skip the native builds and rely on the Docker builds that contain their own SDK). The SDK was installed locally in WSL, so that the native builds (Task 1) and the Docker builds run on the same Linux machine.

`apt` required a sudo password, so the official Microsoft install script was used instead (user-level install, no root):

```text
$ curl -fsSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -o dotnet-install.sh
$ bash dotnet-install.sh --channel 10.0 --install-dir "$HOME/.dotnet"
dotnet-install: Installed version is 10.0.403
dotnet-install: Installation finished successfully.

$ export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet PATH=$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH
$ dotnet --list-sdks
10.0.403 [/home/inteli/.dotnet/sdk]
```

### Notes for the next tasks

- **Line endings:** Windows Git uses `core.autocrlf=true`. A shell script such as `mvnw` checked out with CRLF fails on Linux (`/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter`). A `.gitattributes` file that forces LF (and CRLF only for `*.cmd`) is added in Task 1.
- Native builds and Docker builds are executed in **WSL2**. They were not repeated on native Windows.

---

## Task 1 – Sample applications and native builds

All commands in this task were run **natively in WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04)** with .NET SDK 10.0.403 and OpenJDK 21.0.12, on the branch `task-1-native-builds`.

### 1.1 .NET

#### Generation

```text
$ mkdir dotnet-app && cd dotnet-app
$ dotnet new webapi  -n DemoApi       -o src/DemoApi          # The template "ASP.NET Core Web API" was created successfully.
$ dotnet new xunit   -n DemoApi.Tests -o tests/DemoApi.Tests  # The template "xUnit Test Project" was created successfully.
$ dotnet add tests/DemoApi.Tests reference src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj
Reference `..\..\src\DemoApi\DemoApi.csproj` added to the project.
$ dotnet new sln -n DemoApp                                   # creates DemoApp.slnx on .NET 10
$ dotnet sln add src/DemoApi tests/DemoApi.Tests
Project `src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj` added to the solution.
Project `tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj` added to the solution.
$ dotnet new gitignore
$ dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 10.0.100 --roll-forward latestFeature
```

`Directory.Build.props` was added exactly as given in the lab (`Version=0.1.0`, `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`). The generated `.gitignore` already contains `[Bb]in/`, `[Oo]bj/` and `publish/`, so nothing had to be added. `git status --ignored` confirms that `bin/`, `obj/` and `publish/` are ignored.

`global.json` pins the SDK to **major version 10**: `version 10.0.100` with `rollForward: latestFeature` accepts any 10.0.x SDK (feature band 100 or newer). This is deliberate. A strict pin to the local `10.0.403` would break builds on machines and Docker images that have another 10.0 feature band, for example the SDK inside `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0`.

#### Native build (the four commands)

| Step | Command | Result | Wall time |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| restore | `dotnet restore` | both projects restored, exit 0 | 2.75 s |
| compile | `dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore` | `Build succeeded. 0 Warning(s) 0 Error(s)`, exit 0 | 13.05 s |
| test | `dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build` | `Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: 1, Skipped: 0, Total: 1`, exit 0 | 2.85 s |
| publish | `dotnet publish src/DemoApi -c Release -o publish --no-build` | `DemoApi -> .../dotnet-app/publish/`, exit 0 | 2.30 s |

The timings come from `/usr/bin/time` with a warm NuGet cache, because the packages had already been restored by `dotnet new`. The `--no-restore` and `--no-build` flags make every command reuse the output of the previous one instead of repeating it. The Dockerfiles use the same split.

#### Running the published app

```text
$ dotnet publish/DemoApi.dll
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production

$ curl http://localhost:5000/weatherforecast
[{"date":"2026-11-05","temperatureC":45,"summary":"Bracing","temperatureF":112},{"date":"2026-11-06","temperatureC":31,"summary":"Hot","temperatureF":87}, ... ]
HTTP 200
```

The `publish/` folder is **916 KB** (`du -sh`; 927,327 bytes). It contains only what is needed to run the app on an installed ASP.NET Core runtime: `DemoApi.dll` (28,672 B), `DemoApi.pdb`, the `DemoApi` native launcher, `DemoApi.deps.json`, `DemoApi.runtimeconfig.json`, `appsettings*.json`, `web.config`, `DemoApi.staticwebassets.endpoints.json` and the two NuGet dependencies `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.dll` and `Microsoft.OpenApi.dll`. It contains **no** source code, no `obj/` and no SDK. This is exactly what the final image in Task 5 copies.

#### Debug vs Release

Both configurations were built (`dotnet build -c Debug --no-restore` / `-c Release`), and the effective MSBuild properties were read with `dotnet msbuild -getProperty:...`:

| | Debug | Release |
|---|---|---|
| `Optimize` | `false` | `true` |
| `DefineConstants` | `TRACE;DEBUG` | `TRACE;RELEASE` |
| `DebugType` | `portable` | `portable` |
| `DemoApi.dll` | 29,696 B | 28,672 B |
| `DemoApi.pdb` | 34,172 B | 32,468 B |
| `bin/<cfg>/net10.0/` | 924 KB | 916 KB |

**Note:** Debug compiles without IL optimizations and defines the `DEBUG` symbol, so `#if DEBUG` code and `Debug.Assert` are included. The resulting IL is easier to step through in a debugger. Release turns on the compiler optimizations and leaves out the `DEBUG` code, which makes the DLL slightly smaller (1 KB here, since the app is tiny) and faster. Both produce a portable `.pdb` symbol file by default; it is not needed at runtime. Images and deployments always use Release.

#### .NET configuration files in this project

| File | What it does here |
|------|-------------------|
| `src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj` | `Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"` (web project), `TargetFramework net10.0`, `Nullable`/`ImplicitUsings` enabled, one package: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi 10.0.14` |
| `tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj` | Test project (`IsPackable=false`) with xunit 2.9.3, xunit.runner.visualstudio 3.1.4, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk 17.14.1, coverlet.collector 6.0.4 and a `ProjectReference` to `DemoApi.csproj` |
| `DemoApp.slnx` | New XML solution format of .NET 10. It groups the two projects in the folders `/src/` and `/tests/`, so `dotnet restore/build/test` at the folder root handles both |
| `global.json` | Pins the SDK major version (10.0.100+, `latestFeature`) |
| `Directory.Build.props` | Imported automatically by MSBuild into every project below `dotnet-app/`. It sets `Version=0.1.0` (assembly/file version) and `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` (a compiler warning breaks the build) for both projects |
| `nuget.config` | Not created; the default source `nuget.org` is used |
| `src/DemoApi/appsettings*.json`, `Properties/launchSettings.json` | Runtime configuration and the local `dotnet run` profiles. `launchSettings.json` is not used by `dotnet DemoApi.dll` or in containers |

### 1.2 Java

#### Generation

```text
$ curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
    -d type=maven-project -d language=java -d javaVersion=21 \
    -d groupId=hr.demo -d artifactId=demo -d name=demo -d dependencies=web \
    -o demo.zip
```

`unzip` is not installed in this WSL distribution, so the archive was extracted with `python3 -m zipfile -e demo.zip java-app`. This tool does not keep Unix file modes, so the executable bit of `mvnw` was restored with `chmod +x mvnw`.

The generated project contains `pom.xml`, the Maven wrapper (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`: wrapper 3.3.4, `distributionType=only-script`, Maven **3.10.0**), `DemoApplication.java`, one test `DemoApplicationTests.java` (a `contextLoads` test), `application.properties`, a `.gitignore` (ignores `target/` and `HELP.md`) and a `.gitattributes` (`/mvnw text eol=lf`, `*.cmd text eol=crlf`). The `.gitattributes` solves the CRLF problem noted in Task 0.

Spring Boot 4 renamed the `web` starter: the generated `pom.xml` uses `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` and `spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test`.

#### Native build

Maven is **not** installed globally (`mvn: command not found`). The wrapper runs Maven 3.10.0 from `~/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.10.0/`. That distribution, and the dependencies in `~/.m2/repository`, were already cached on this machine from earlier work (dated 2026-10-10), so no downloads happened in this run. The 26 s below is therefore a **warm-cache** time. On a fresh machine, the wrapper first downloads Maven and then all the dependencies.

```text
$ ./mvnw -B -ntp clean verify
[INFO] --- clean:3.5.0:clean (default-clean) @ demo ---
[INFO] --- resources:3.5.0:resources (default-resources) @ demo ---
[INFO] --- compiler:3.15.0:compile (default-compile) @ demo ---
[INFO] --- resources:3.5.0:testResources (default-testResources) @ demo ---
[INFO] --- compiler:3.15.0:testCompile (default-testCompile) @ demo ---
[INFO] --- surefire:3.5.6:test (default-test) @ demo ---
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] --- jar:3.5.1:jar (default-jar) @ demo ---

[INFO] Building jar: .../java-app/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] Total time:  26.179 s
exit=0
```

The plugin executions show the lifecycle: `clean` (separate lifecycle) → `resources` + `compile` (compile phase) → `testResources` + `testCompile` + `surefire:test` (test phase) → `jar:jar` + `spring-boot:repackage` (package phase) → `verify` (no extra plugin bound in this project).

```text
$ ls target/
classes/  demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original  generated-sources/
generated-test-sources/  maven-archiver/  maven-status/  surefire-reports/  test-classes/
```

- `demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`: **20 MB** (19,963,208 B), the executable "fat" JAR made by `spring-boot:repackage`, with all dependencies (Tomcat, Spring) under `BOOT-INF/lib/`
- `demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original`: 2,578 B, the plain JAR made by `jar:jar` (only our classes)
- `surefire-reports/`: `TEST-hr.demo.demo.DemoApplicationTests.xml` and `.txt` (test reports)

#### Running the JAR

```text
$ java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
 :: Spring Boot ::                (v4.1.2)
... Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/'
... Started DemoApplication in 4.78 seconds (process running for 6.032)

$ curl http://localhost:8080/
{"timestamp":"2026-11-04T15:57:30.831Z","status":404,"error":"Not Found","path":"/"}
HTTP 404
```

The template has **no controller**, and the lab writes no application logic. The JSON 404 is produced by Spring Boot's own error handling and proves that the embedded Tomcat is up and that the Spring application answers HTTP requests. The same check is used for the Java containers.

#### `pom.xml` sections

| Section | Content in this project | What it does |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| `<parent>` | `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent:4.1.2` | Inherits the dependency versions (a BOM in `<dependencyManagement>`), plugin versions and plugin configuration from Spring Boot. That is why our dependencies and plugins have no `<version>` |
| `<groupId>/<artifactId>/<version>` | `hr.demo:demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` | The coordinates of the artifact. They produce the name `demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` |
| `<properties>` | `java.version=21` | Read by the parent, which sets the compiler `release` to 21: bytecode for Java 21 |
| `<dependencies>` | `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` (compile scope); `spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test` (`test` scope) | What the app needs: Spring MVC + embedded Tomcat at runtime; JUnit, Spring Test and MockMvc only for compiling and running tests (not in the final JAR) |
| `<build><plugins>` | `spring-boot-maven-plugin` | Adds the `repackage` goal to the `package` phase, which turns the plain JAR into an executable fat JAR with a `Main-Class` launcher |

### Build steps per ecosystem (reused in the Dockerfiles)

| Stage | .NET | Java (Maven) |
|-------|------|--------------|
| restore / resolve dependencies | `dotnet restore` | `./mvnw -B -ntp dependency:go-offline` (implicit in every phase) |
| compile | `dotnet build -c Release --no-restore` | `./mvnw -B -ntp compile` |
| test | `dotnet test -c Release --no-build` | `./mvnw -B -ntp test` |
| package / publish | `dotnet publish src/DemoApi -c Release -o publish --no-build` | `./mvnw -B -ntp package` (or `-DskipTests`) |
| all in one | the four commands above | `./mvnw -B -ntp clean verify` |
| artifact | `publish/` folder (916 KB) | `target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` (20 MB) |

### Versioning of generated files

The build outputs are excluded from Git: `dotnet-app/.gitignore` (`[Bb]in/`, `[Oo]bj/`, `publish/`) and `java-app/.gitignore` (`target/`, `HELP.md`). The repository uses `core.filemode=false` (NTFS), so the executable bit of `mvnw` is stored explicitly in the Git index with `git update-index --chmod=+x java-app/mvnw`.

## Task 2 – Anatomy of a Dockerfile and of `docker build`

Task 2 is mostly theory. To answer its questions with real observations instead of only the lab's tables, a small **throwaway** Dockerfile was built against the real `dotnet-app/` context. It uses one instruction of each kind and is **not committed**: it only lives in this report. Base image `alpine:3.20`, Docker Engine 28.5.1 / BuildKit v0.25.1 on WSL2.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.anatomy (experiment only)
FROM alpine:3.20
WORKDIR /app
COPY Directory.Build.props global.json ./
RUN wc -c Directory.Build.props global.json > sizes.txt
ARG BUILD_NOTE=demo
ENV APP_ENV=lab
EXPOSE 8080
USER nobody
ENTRYPOINT ["cat"]
CMD ["sizes.txt"]
```

### 2.2 / 2.3 Reading a real build (`--progress=plain`)

First build (`docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.anatomy -t anatomy-demo .` inside `dotnet-app/`):

```text

#9 naming to docker.io/library/anatomy-demo done                   ← tag applied, loaded into local store (step 8)
```

The same command run a second time, with no change:

```text
#4 [1/4] FROM docker.io/library/alpine:3.20@sha256:d9e8...
#5 transferring context: 73B 0.0s done
#6 [2/4] WORKDIR /app
#6 CACHED
#7 [3/4] COPY Directory.Build.props global.json ./
#7 CACHED
#8 [4/4] RUN wc -c Directory.Build.props global.json > sizes.txt
#8 CACHED
#9 writing image sha256:a304707936c9... done                        ← identical image ID
```

Observations:

- The tag `alpine:3.20` was resolved to a **digest** (`@sha256:d9e8...`). That is what the build really uses.
- Only the instructions that touch the filesystem (`WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`) appear as `[n/4]` steps. `ARG`, `ENV`, `EXPOSE`, `USER`, `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` have no step in the output: they are only written into the image config during `exporting to image`.
- The context transfer was only **326 B**, although `dotnet-app/` contains `bin/`, `obj/` and `publish/` from Task 1. BuildKit only sends the paths that the Dockerfile actually needs (here the two `COPY` sources), and on a repeated build only what changed (73 B). With `COPY . .` (Task 3), the whole folder has to be sent, which makes `.dockerignore` matter (Task 4).

### Layers vs metadata (evidence)

$ docker image inspect anatomy-demo --format '{{json .RootFS.Layers}}'     # 4 filesystem layers
["sha256:08bc4e53...", "sha256:94683cce...", "sha256:58b01f54...", "sha256:15ad8f62..."]
#  = alpine base, WORKDIR /app (creates the directory), COPY, RUN

$ docker image inspect anatomy-demo --format 'Entrypoint={{json .Config.Entrypoint}} Cmd={{json .Config.Cmd}} User={{json .Config.User}} WorkingDir={{json .Config.WorkingDir}} Env={{json .Config.Env}} ExposedPorts={{json .Config.ExposedPorts}}'
Entrypoint=["cat"] Cmd=["sizes.txt"] User="nobody" WorkingDir="/app" Env=["PATH=...","APP_ENV=lab"] ExposedPorts={"8080/tcp":{}}
```

`docker images` reports **7.81 MB**: the alpine layer plus 236 B + 70 B. Every metadata instruction is 0 B. They do not exist as layers; they live in `.Config`. `WORKDIR` is listed as 0 B but still produced a (nearly empty) filesystem layer, because it created the `/app` directory. That matches the lab's "metadata (plus the directory)".

**A metadata-only change does not touch the layers.** In a copy of the Dockerfile, only `ENV APP_ENV=lab` was changed to `lab2`. All filesystem steps were `CACHED`, and the result has **the same four layer digests** but a **different image ID**, because the image ID is the hash of the config, and the config changed:

**A file change invalidates its layer and everything after it (Rule 1).** In a scratch copy of the context, `global.json` was edited (`latestFeature` → `latestPatch`) and the image rebuilt:

```

### Runtime behavior (ENTRYPOINT/CMD, ENV/ARG)

```text
$ docker run --rm anatomy-demo                       # ENTRYPOINT ["cat"] + CMD ["sizes.txt"]
      149 Directory.Build.props
       87 global.json
      236 total

$ docker run --rm anatomy-demo /etc/alpine-release   # arguments replace CMD, ENTRYPOINT stays
3.20.10

$ docker run --rm --entrypoint sh anatomy-demo -c 'echo "APP_ENV=$APP_ENV BUILD_NOTE=${BUILD_NOTE:-<unset>} user=$(id -un)"'
APP_ENV=lab BUILD_NOTE=<unset> user=nobody
```

### Answers

**1. Which instructions produce layers with files, and which only change metadata? Why does it matter for the size?**

`FROM` (brings in the base image's layers), `COPY`/`ADD` and `RUN` create layers with files. `WORKDIR` creates only an empty directory if it does not exist yet. `ENV`, `ARG`, `LABEL`, `EXPOSE`, `USER`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `CMD` and `HEALTHCHECK` only change the image configuration. The `docker history` above shows them all with 0 B, and the config change kept the same layer digests.

It matters because the image size is the **sum of its file layers**, and layers are immutable. A file added in one layer and deleted in a later `RUN` is still stored in the earlier layer; the deletion only hides it. The size is therefore decided by `FROM` (which base image) and by what `COPY`/`RUN` put in. For this lab:

- The .NET build output is only 916 KB (Task 1), but an image based on `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0` carries the whole SDK.
- `COPY . .` also copies `bin/`, `obj/` and `publish/` into a layer.

Adding `ENV` or `LABEL` lines, on the other hand, costs nothing. Shrinking an image means choosing a smaller `FROM` and copying fewer files: a multi-stage build (Task 5) and `.dockerignore` (Task 4).

**2. Why does Rule 1 make the order of instructions important?**

The cache key of a step includes its **parent layer**. When one step misses the cache, every later step has a new parent, so each of them misses too, even if its own text and inputs did not change. The experiment shows it: only `global.json` changed, yet the `RUN` after the `COPY` was executed again.

The cache can therefore only be reused up to the **first** changed step, and the order decides how much work a typical change costs. If an expensive step (`dotnet restore` downloading NuGet packages, `mvn dependency:go-offline` downloading the Maven repository) comes **after** a `COPY` of frequently changing files (`COPY . .` with `Program.cs`), every code edit repeats the download. If it comes **after a `COPY` of only the dependency files** (`DemoApi.csproj`, `pom.xml`), a code edit leaves it cached and only the compile step runs again. This is the change from `Dockerfile.naive` to `Dockerfile.cache` in Task 4.

**3. `ENTRYPOINT` vs `CMD`, and `ENV` vs `ARG`?**

- **`ENTRYPOINT`** is the program that the container always runs. **`CMD`** holds its *default arguments* (or the default command, if there is no `ENTRYPOINT`). Arguments after the image name in `docker run` **replace `CMD`** but keep the `ENTRYPOINT`. Above, `docker run anatomy-demo /etc/alpine-release` still ran `cat`, now on a different file. Replacing the `ENTRYPOINT` needs an explicit `--entrypoint`. For the lab apps, `ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DemoApi.dll"]` makes the container *be* the API. Both should use the exec form (JSON array), so that the app runs as PID 1 and receives `SIGTERM`.
- **`ARG`** exists **only during the build**. Its value is set with `--build-arg`, and it is scoped to the stage in which it is declared. **`ENV`** is stored in the image config and is present **in every running container** (and in later build steps). Above, `APP_ENV=lab` was set at runtime and `BUILD_NOTE` was not. For the lab apps, `ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080` configures the running API, while `ARG APP_VERSION` (Task 6) only feeds the build.

  **Warning:** `docker history` shows the `ARG` line (`ARG BUILD_NOTE=demo`). Build arguments are therefore *not* secret. Task 6.5 demonstrates the leak.

The experiment images (`anatomy-demo:*`) were deleted after the observations.

## Task 3 – Naive Dockerfiles

Both Dockerfiles are exactly the ones from the lab and are kept unchanged as the baseline: [`dotnet-app/Dockerfile.naive`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/Dockerfile.naive) and [`java-app/Dockerfile.naive`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/java-app/Dockerfile.naive).

```dockerfile
# dotnet-app/Dockerfile.naive
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj -c Release -o out
ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "out/DemoApi.dll"]
```

```dockerfile
# java-app/Dockerfile.naive
FROM maven:3-eclipse-temurin-21
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn -B -ntp package -DskipTests
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
```

Conditions: Docker Engine 28.5.1 / BuildKit v0.25.1 on WSL2. Both base images were pulled during these builds, so this is a cold build. There is no `.dockerignore` yet, and the working folders still contain the outputs of the Task 1 native builds (`dotnet-app`: `bin/` + `obj/` + `publish/` ≈ 16 MB; `java-app/target/` = 20 MB). That is the realistic situation of a developer machine.

### 3.1 .NET – build and run

```text
$ cd dotnet-app
$ docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.naive -t demo-dotnet:naive .

The SDK inside the image is 10.0.403 (`docker exec ... dotnet --list-sdks`), so the `global.json` from Task 1 (10.0.100, `latestFeature`) is satisfied.

### Answers

**Which layer is the largest? Why does a runtime image contain the whole SDK, the source code and the `obj/` folders?**

The largest layers belong to the **base image**, not to our application:

- **.NET:** `COPY /dotnet /usr/share/dotnet` (**531 MB**, the .NET SDK), followed by the Ubuntu base (78.2 MB), the apt packages (74.9 MB + 42 MB) and PowerShell (60.9 MB + 21.1 MB). Our own two layers add only 22 MB to 940 MB.
- **Java:** the JDK layer `RUN ... ARCH="$(dpkg ...` (**308 MB**), followed by the Ubuntu base (102 MB) and the apt packages (76.3 MB + 67 MB). Among our own layers, `RUN mvn package` (83.8 MB) is the largest: it contains the whole Maven local repository `/root/.m2` (69 MB of downloaded plugins and dependencies) plus the rebuilt `target/`.

The runtime image contains all of this because a single-stage Dockerfile **has only one image**: the one used to build is the one that is shipped. Everything that `FROM` brought in for building (SDK/JDK, Maven, compilers, PowerShell) and everything that `COPY . .` and `RUN` put on disk stays in the layers:

- `COPY . .` copied the whole build context: the source code, `tests/`, `Dockerfile.naive`, and also the local `bin/`, `obj/` and `publish/` folders from Task 1 (15.9 MB), because there is no `.dockerignore`.
- `dotnet publish` then created a new `obj/` and `bin/` inside the image and filled the NuGet cache.

Nothing is ever removed, and even a `rm` in a later step would not shrink the earlier layers.

**Which user does the application run as?**

`root` (uid 0) in both images. `.Config.User` is empty (`""`), which means root, and `docker exec ... id` / `ps` confirm that PID 1 (`dotnet` / `java`) runs as `root`. The SDK image even defines a non-root user `app` (`APP_UID=1654`, visible in `docker history`), but the naive Dockerfile never switches to it.

**At least three problems with these images:**

1. **Size:** 940 MB and 669 MB to ship a 916 KB folder and a 20 MB JAR. Every pull, push and deploy moves hundreds of MB, and the registry and nodes store them.
2. **Attack surface:** the images ship a full SDK/JDK, a compiler, Maven, PowerShell, `apt`, a shell and many OS packages. An attacker who gets into the container has a complete toolchain, and every one of these packages adds CVEs to scan and patch.
3. **Runs as root:** a vulnerability in the app gives root inside the container, which makes a container escape or tampering with the filesystem much easier.
4. **Source code and build leftovers in the image:** the source, tests, `Dockerfile.naive`, `obj/` and `bin/` from the developer's machine (even `HELP.md` and `.gitignore`), plus `/root/.nuget` and `/root/.m2`. Any local file, for example a `.env` with secrets, would be copied the same way.
5. **Slow rebuilds:** `COPY . .` comes before the restore/package step. Any change to any file, even a comment or a README, invalidates the `COPY` layer, and by Rule 1 the dependency download (NuGet restore, the 69 MB Maven repository) runs again. A large context (16–20 MB without `.dockerignore`) is also sent on every build. Task 4 measures this.
6. **Not reproducible:** the result depends on what is lying in the local folder. The Java build runs `mvn package` without `clean` on top of the copied local `target/`. The base images are referenced by moving tags (`sdk:10.0`, `maven:3-eclipse-temurin-21`).
7. **No tests:** `-DskipTests` skips the tests, and the .NET Dockerfile never runs `dotnet test` (addressed in Task 6).

## Task 4 – Layer cache and `.dockerignore`

Environment: Docker Engine 28.5.1 / BuildKit v0.25.1 on WSL2, branch `task-4-cache-dockerignore`. All temporary edits below (one character in `Program.cs`, an extra NuGet package in `DemoApi.csproj`, other base image tags) were made only for measuring. Afterwards they were reverted from a byte-exact backup, verified with `sha256sum -c`. The base-image experiments used temporary copies of `Dockerfile.cache` outside the repository, so the committed files contain none of these changes.

### 4.1 Observing (and breaking) the cache with the naive Dockerfile

**Rebuild without editing anything.** The first rebuild in this task was, surprisingly, **not** fully cached:

```text
$ docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.naive -t demo-dotnet:naive .
#5 transferring context: 35.14kB 4.8s done
#6 [2/4] WORKDIR /app
#6 CACHED
#7 [3/4] COPY . .                                             ← executed, not CACHED
#8 [4/4] RUN dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj ...    ← executed, not CACHED
[wall 12.95s]
```

Investigation: `file Dockerfile.naive` reported `CRLF line terminators`, with a modification time of 17:11:19, which is exactly when `git switch main && git pull` ran with Windows Git (`core.autocrlf=true`). The checkout had rewritten `Dockerfile.naive` (committed in Task 3 with LF) with CRLF endings. Without a `.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile.naive` is part of the context and is copied by `COPY . .`, so its new checksum invalidated the `COPY` layer and, by Rule 1, the `RUN` after it. This is a real example of a file that has **nothing to do with the application** breaking the cache, which the `Dockerfile*` line of `.dockerignore` (4.2) prevents.

Running the same command again, now without any change:

```text
#6 [2/4] WORKDIR /app
#6 CACHED
#7 [3/4] COPY . .
#7 CACHED
#8 [4/4] RUN dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj -c Release -o out
#8 CACHED
```

**Edit one character in `src/DemoApi/Program.cs`** (`// Add services to the container.` → `...container!`, a comment):

```text
$ docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.naive -t demo-dotnet:naive .
#6 [2/4] WORKDIR /app
#6 CACHED
#7 [3/4] COPY . .
#7 DONE 0.1s                                                   ← rebuilt
#8 [4/4] RUN dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj -c Release -o out
#8 3.075   Restored /app/src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj (in 1.59 sec).   ← NuGet restore repeated
#8 6.284   DemoApi -> /app/src/DemoApi/bin/Release/net10.0/DemoApi.dll
#8 6.356   DemoApi -> /app/out/
#8 DONE 6.5s                                                   ← rebuilt
[wall 12.97s]
```

**Which steps were rebuilt?** `COPY . .` and `RUN dotnet publish`. Only `FROM` and `WORKDIR` were reused.

**Was the NuGet restore repeated? Why?** Yes (`Restored ... (in 1.59 sec)`). `dotnet publish` restores implicitly, and the restore happens in the same `RUN` layer as the compilation. That layer comes after `COPY . .`, whose cache key contains the checksum of **every** file in the context. A comment in `Program.cs` changes that checksum, so the `COPY` layer misses the cache, and by Rule 1 so does the `RUN`, including the dependency download that has not changed at all. With only one small package, the restore costs about 1.6 s here. In a real project with many packages, every code edit would pay for the complete download again.

### 4.2 `.dockerignore`

Both files were created exactly as in the lab: [`dotnet-app/.dockerignore`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/.dockerignore) and [`java-app/.dockerignore`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/java-app/.dockerignore).

**How it was measured.** BuildKit transfers the context *incrementally*: on a repeated build it only sends what changed (see the 35 kB above). To compare full context sizes, the context-transfer cache of the builder was cleared before each measurement with `docker builder prune -f --filter type=source.local` (this does not remove any layer cache). Then the naive build was run and its `transferring context` line recorded. In addition, the content that actually arrives in the builder was counted with a throwaway Dockerfile (`FROM alpine:3.20` / `COPY . /ctx` / `RUN find /ctx -type f | wc -l; du -sh /ctx`, built with `--no-cache`).

| Context | `transferring context` (full) | Files | Size in builder | Largest parts |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| `dotnet-app/` **without** `.dockerignore` | **15.99 MB** | 334 | 16.4 MB | `tests/` 12.9 MB (test `bin/`), `src/` 2.5 MB (`bin/`, `obj/`), `publish/` 940 KB, `Dockerfile.naive`, `.gitignore` |
| `dotnet-app/` **with** `.dockerignore` | **4.55 kB** | 11 | 68 KB | `src/` 36 KB, `tests/` 16 KB, `DemoApp.slnx`, `Directory.Build.props`, `global.json` |
| `java-app/` **without** `.dockerignore` | **20.02 MB** | 23 | 19.3 MB | `target/` 19.2 MB (fat JAR, classes), `src/` 68 KB, `mvnw*`, `.mvn/` |
| `java-app/` **with** `.dockerignore` | **23.48 kB** | 8 | 116 KB | `src/` 68 KB, `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, `.mvn/`, `pom.xml`, `.gitattributes` |

The context shrank by about **3,500×** for .NET (15.99 MB → 4.55 kB, 334 → 11 files) and about **850×** for Java (20.02 MB → 23.48 kB, 23 → 8 files). What is left is only the source and the build definitions.

Side effects observed:

- The naive images got smaller, because `COPY . .` no longer copies the local build output: `demo-dotnet:naive` **940 MB → 925 MB**, `demo-java:naive` **669 MB → 649 MB**.
- The images are now reproducible from the sources. The local `bin/`, `obj/` and `target/` of the developer's machine can no longer leak into the image, and a local `.env` would be excluded.
- Files that are irrelevant for the build (`Dockerfile*`, `*.md`, `.gitignore`) can no longer invalidate the cache, which is exactly what happened in 4.1 with the CRLF rewrite of `Dockerfile.naive`.

### 4.3 Ordering the instructions for the cache

[`dotnet-app/Dockerfile.cache`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/Dockerfile.cache), exactly as in the lab:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0
WORKDIR /src

# 1. dependency definition only → this layer changes rarely
COPY Directory.Build.props ./
COPY src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj src/DemoApi/
RUN dotnet restore src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj

# 2. source code → this layer changes often
COPY src/DemoApi/ src/DemoApi/
RUN dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj -c Release -o /app --no-restore

ENV ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DemoApi.dll"]
```

**Naive vs cache-friendly order.** The naive file copies *everything* and then runs one command that restores and compiles. The cache-friendly file copies only the files that define dependencies (`Directory.Build.props`, `DemoApi.csproj`), restores, and only then copies the source and compiles with `--no-restore`. The expensive restore layer now depends only on the dependency definition, not on the code.

Git note: the `.gitignore` generated by `dotnet new gitignore` contains the Visual Studio rule `*.[Cc]ache` (line 236), which matched `Dockerfile.cache`, so the file would silently never have been committed (`git check-ignore -v dotnet-app/Dockerfile.cache` → `dotnet-app/.gitignore:236:*.[Cc]ache`). An exception `!Dockerfile.cache` was added at the end of `dotnet-app/.gitignore`.

Initial build (`docker build -f Dockerfile.cache -t demo-dotnet:cache .`): all 8 steps executed, `Restored ... (in 1.5 sec)`, wall time 9.56 s. `docker run -p 8080:8080 demo-dotnet:cache` + `curl /weatherforecast` → **HTTP 200**. Size **925 MB** (still the full SDK; Task 5 fixes that).

#### Cache table (from the real `--progress=plain` logs)

| Change you make | `COPY ...csproj` | `RUN dotnet restore` | `COPY src/DemoApi/` | `RUN dotnet publish` | Wall time |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Nothing (rebuild) | CACHED | CACHED | CACHED | CACHED | 1.75 s |
| Edit `Program.cs` (one character in a comment) | CACHED | CACHED | **rebuilt** | **rebuilt** | 5.85 s |
| Add a NuGet package to the `.csproj` (`Humanizer.Core 2.14.1`) | **rebuilt** | **rebuilt** (`Restored ... in 1.8 sec`) | **rebuilt** | **rebuilt** | 9.14 s |
| Change the base image tag `10.0` → `10.0.0` (as in the lab) | – | – | – | – | **build failed** (1.14 s) |
| … → `10.0.403` (another tag, **same digest** as `10.0`) | CACHED | CACHED | CACHED | CACHED | 1.34 s |
| … → `10.0.100` (another tag, **different digest**) | **rebuilt** | **rebuilt** (`Restored ... in 1.48 sec`) | **rebuilt** | **rebuilt** | 36.99 s (25.1 s of it pulling the image) |

`WORKDIR /src` and `COPY Directory.Build.props` behaved like the `.csproj` column. They were rebuilt only in the base-image row.

Notes on the rows:

- **Edit `Program.cs`:** the first two dependency steps were `CACHED`. The restore was *not* repeated: compare 4.1, where the same edit repeated it.
- **Add a NuGet package:** `COPY src/DemoApi/` would have been rebuilt anyway, because the `.csproj` also lives in `src/DemoApi/`. By Rule 1 it is rebuilt in any case, since its parent (the restore layer) is new.
- **`10.0.0`:** the lab's example tag does **not exist** for the SDK image, because SDK tags use SDK versions (`10.0.100` … `10.0.403`):

  ```text
  #2 ERROR: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0.0: not found
  ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0.0: failed to resolve source metadata for mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0.0: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0.0: not found
  ```

  The registry's tag list (`https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/dotnet/sdk/tags/list`) and `docker buildx imagetools inspect` were then used to pick two existing tags:

  ```text
  10.0       Digest: sha256:de4fe90a98845d75910b9769662465c84de1a934665c431279d1382b2bddc02b
  10.0.403   Digest: sha256:de4fe90a98845d75910b9769662465c84de1a934665c431279d1382b2bddc02b
  10.0.100   Digest: sha256:c7445f141c04f1a6b454181bd098dcfa606c61ba0bd213d0a702489e5bd4cd71
  ```

- **`10.0.403`:** everything was `CACHED`. The cache key of `FROM` is the **resolved digest**, not the text of the tag, and `10.0.403` is currently the same image as `10.0`.
- **`10.0.100`:** a different digest, so every later step was rebuilt, after a 25 s download of the other SDK image.

**Conclusion.** The most expensive change is a change of the **base image** (a different digest). It is the first layer, so by Rule 1 every layer is rebuilt: the new base image (hundreds of MB) is downloaded, all dependencies are restored again, and the code is compiled again (37 s here, against 6 s for a code edit). This also happens without editing the Dockerfile at all, when a moving tag such as `10.0` gets a new patch release, which is why pinning the base image by version or digest matters. The next most expensive change is a **change of the dependencies** (`.csproj`/`pom.xml`): restore and everything after it run again (9.1 s). The cheapest change is the most frequent one, a **source code edit**: with `Dockerfile.cache` it only repeats `COPY src` + `publish` (5.9 s), while the restore stays cached. With `Dockerfile.naive`, the same edit also repeated the restore. In this tiny demo, the restore only takes about 1.5–3 s, so the absolute gain is small. The *structure* is what matters, because in a real project the restore and download are often the slowest part of the build.

## Task 5 – Multi-stage builds

Environment: Docker Engine 28.5.1 / BuildKit v0.25.1 on WSL2, branch `task-5-multistage`. Both Dockerfiles are exactly the ones from the lab: [`dotnet-app/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/Dockerfile) and [`java-app/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/java-app/Dockerfile). The earlier variants (`Dockerfile.naive`, `Dockerfile.cache`) are kept unchanged.

### 5.1 .NET

```text
$ cd dotnet-app && docker build --progress=plain -t demo-dotnet:multistage .
#3 docker-image://docker.io/docker/dockerfile:1@sha256:4edf897a3ffa...       ← the "# syntax=" line loads the Dockerfile frontend

#8 [final 1/3] FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0@sha256:de0ee358cdd6...
#11 [build 2/7] WORKDIR /src                                  CACHED

#13 [build 4/7] COPY src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj src/DemoApi/  CACHED
#14 [build 5/7] RUN dotnet restore src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj CACHED
#15 [build 6/7] COPY src/DemoApi/ src/DemoApi/                CACHED
#16 [build 7/7] RUN dotnet publish ... -o /app/publish --no-restore
#16 6.243   DemoApi -> /app/publish/
#17 [final 3/3] COPY --from=build /app/publish .
exit=0, wall 11.60 s
```

Steps 2–6 of the `build` stage were already `CACHED` on the very first build, because they are **identical** to the steps of `Dockerfile.cache` (same base image digest, same instructions, same files). The BuildKit cache is shared between Dockerfiles; only `publish` (a different `-o` path) had to run.

```text
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 demo-dotnet:multistage
      Now listening on: http://[::]:8080
$ curl http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast

$ docker exec <container> sh -c 'id; grep Uid /proc/1/status; cat /proc/1/cmdline; dotnet --list-sdks; dotnet --list-runtimes; ls /app'
id: uid=1654(app) gid=1654(app) groups=1654(app)
Uid:    1654    1654    1654    1654
PID1: dotnet DemoApi.dll
dotnet --list-sdks:        (empty: no SDK in the image)
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.14 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.14 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
/app: DemoApi DemoApi.deps.json DemoApi.dll DemoApi.pdb DemoApi.runtimeconfig.json
      DemoApi.staticwebassets.endpoints.json Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi.dll Microsoft.OpenApi.dll
      appsettings.Development.json appsettings.json web.config            (940 KB)
/root/.nuget, /src: No such file or directory
```

The final image contains only the ASP.NET Core **runtime** and the published files. There is no SDK, no source, no `obj/` and no NuGet cache. The process runs as `app` (uid 1654): `USER $APP_UID` was resolved at build time and is stored as `USER 1654` (see `docker history` below). The image still contains a shell and `apt-get` (Debian-based runtime image); the chiseled variant (optional, below) removes those.

### 5.2 Java

```text
$ cd java-app && docker build --progress=plain -t demo-java:multistage .
#7 [build 1/6] FROM docker.io/library/maven:3-eclipse-temurin-21@sha256:9673eef9ed50...   CACHED

#14 [final 3/4] RUN groupadd --system app && useradd --system --gid app --no-create-home app
#12 22.01 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

#17 [final 4/4] COPY --from=build /build/target/*.jar app.jar
exit=0, wall 33.54 s
```

The interleaved `[build …]` and `[final …]` lines show step 6 of the build breakdown (Task 2): the two stages are independent until `COPY --from=build`, so BuildKit pulled the JRE image and created the user **while** Maven was downloading the dependencies.

```

The JAR is owned by root and is only readable (`-rw-r--r--`) by the `app` user. That is enough to run it, and the application cannot modify its own code.

None of the build-stage instructions (`COPY pom.xml`, `dependency:go-offline`, `dotnet restore`, `dotnet publish`, …) appear in these histories. The only trace of the `build` stage is the result of `COPY --from=build`: 926 kB (.NET) and 20 MB (Java).

### 5.3 Comparison table

**How it was measured.**

- **Size:** `docker images` (exact bytes from `docker image inspect --format '{{.Size}}'`).
- **Tools:** checked with `docker exec`/`docker run --entrypoint`: `dotnet --list-sdks`, `dotnet --list-runtimes`, `ls $JAVA_HOME/bin`, `which javac mvn`.
- **User:** `.Config.User` plus `id` inside a running container.
- **Rebuild time:** wall time of `docker build --progress=plain -f <file> -t <tag> .` measured with `/usr/bin/time`. Conditions:
  - all on WSL2, with the Task 4 `.dockerignore` files in place;
  - base images already present and the cache **warm** (one untimed build of each variant right before);
  - before each timed build, a new comment line was appended to `src/DemoApi/Program.cs` (.NET) or `src/main/java/hr/demo/demo/DemoApplication.java` (Java);
  - **3 runs per variant**, median reported;
  - the source files were restored afterwards (`sha256sum -c` OK).

  The build context lives on the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/...`). In these runs the context transfer itself took 0.2–0.4 s; the rest of the wall time beyond the build steps is BuildKit overhead (resolving metadata, exporting the image). The absolute numbers are only comparable within this table.

| Image | Size | Contains SDK/JDK/Maven? | Runs as root? | Rebuild time after editing a source file (median; 3 runs) |
|-------|------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `demo-dotnet:naive` | **925 MB** | Yes: .NET SDK 10.0.403 (+ PowerShell) | **Yes** (uid 0, `User=""`) | **12.27 s** (10.71 / 12.27 / 12.29): `COPY . .` + `RUN dotnet publish` incl. restore (`Restored ... in 2.1 sec`, step 9.7 s) |
| `demo-dotnet:cache` | **925 MB** | Yes: .NET SDK 10.0.403 | **Yes** (uid 0, `User=""`) | **8.47 s** (8.71 / 8.47 / 8.14): restore `CACHED`, only `COPY src` + `publish` (6.4 s) |
| `demo-dotnet:multistage` | **231 MB** | No: ASP.NET Core runtime 10.0.14 only | No: `app` (uid 1654) | **7.81 s** (8.99 / 7.81 / 7.52): restore `CACHED`, `publish` (4.7 s) + `COPY --from` |
| `demo-java:naive` | **649 MB** | Yes: JDK 21.0.13 + Maven 3.10.0 | **Yes** (uid 0, `User=""`) | **22.72 s** (22.72 / 22.80 / 19.50): `RUN mvn package` downloads all dependencies again (19.3 s) |
| `demo-java:multistage` | **340 MB** | No: JRE 21.0.13 only (no `javac`, no `mvn`) | No: `app` (uid 999) | **9.48 s** (9.48 / 9.37 / 9.73): `dependency:go-offline` `CACHED`, only `COPY src` + `mvn package` (5.7 s) |

The naive sizes are the values after Task 4 (with `.dockerignore`). The Task 3 values, without it, were 940 MB and 669 MB.

Observations:

- **Size:** multi-stage shrinks the .NET image by 75 % (925 → 231 MB) and the Java image by 48 % (649 → 340 MB). Of the 231 MB, only 926 kB is our application; the rest is the runtime base image.
- **Rebuild time:** the big win is the dependency layer. For Java, the median drops from 22.7 s to 9.5 s, because the naive build downloads all Maven dependencies on every code edit. For .NET, the gain is smaller (12.3 → 8.5 → 7.8 s), because this app has only one NuGet package.
- **The multi-stage build can even skip the final `COPY`.** In `demo-java:multistage`, `COPY --from=build ... app.jar` was **`CACHED`** after a comment edit. The comment does not change the bytecode, and `spring-boot:repackage` produces a reproducible JAR (fixed timestamps, `Feb 1 1980`), so the copied file had the same checksum and the final layers were reused.

### Answers

**1. Why is the JDK needed in the build stage, but a JRE is enough in the final stage?**

Building means compiling `.java` sources to bytecode with `javac`, and packaging with `jar` / the Spring Boot plugin. These tools are part of the JDK (Java Development Kit), and Maven itself needs a JDK. Running the application only needs the JVM and the class library, which is the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The final image's `$JAVA_HOME/bin` indeed contains only `java`, `jfr`, `jrunscript`, `jwebserver`, `keytool` and `rmiregistry`, and no `javac`. The JRE layer is 166 MB against 308 MB for the JDK in the Maven image, and the compiler is no longer available to an attacker.

**2. Why are tests skipped inside the image build (`-DskipTests`)?**

- **Speed and the cache:** tests run on every rebuild of the `package` layer, and the Spring `contextLoads` test starts a whole application context (about 3.4 s for the single test class, see 6.3).
- **Reports are lost:** test reports written inside a build layer are not easily accessible.
- **Responsibility:** the image build should produce the artifact. In this Dockerfile the tests would run in the build stage, whose content is thrown away anyway.
- **Test dependencies:** tests often need things that are not available during `docker build`, such as databases or network.

Skipping them here is a trade-off, not a recommendation. Task 6 adds a **separate `test` stage**, so that tests run only when they are explicitly targeted.

**3. Why is `COPY pom.xml .` followed by `dependency:go-offline` before `COPY src ./src`?**

It applies Rules 1 and 2. `pom.xml` (the dependency definition) changes rarely, and the source changes often. Copying only `pom.xml` and running `dependency:go-offline` downloads all dependencies and plugins into `/root/.m2` in a layer whose cache key depends **only on `pom.xml`**. A code change then invalidates only `COPY src` and `mvn package`, while the download stays `CACHED`. Measured above: 9.5 s instead of 22.7 s per rebuild.

**4. Which instructions of the final stage only change the metadata, and which add files?**

- **.NET:** `FROM ...aspnet:10.0` adds the runtime base layers. `WORKDIR /app` creates the directory (an almost empty layer, 0 B in history). `COPY --from=build /app/publish .` adds the files (926 kB). `EXPOSE 8080`, `USER $APP_UID` and `ENTRYPOINT [...]` are metadata only (0 B).
- **Java:** `FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre` adds the base layers. `WORKDIR /app` creates the directory. `RUN groupadd ... && useradd ...` adds files (4.71 kB: the changes to `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/shadow`). `COPY --from=build ... app.jar` adds 20 MB. `USER app`, `EXPOSE 8080` and `ENTRYPOINT [...]` are metadata only.

**5. What happens to the `build` stage when the build finishes? Is it in the final image?**

No. The `build` stage only exists as **build cache** in BuildKit, which is why the next build can reuse its layers (`CACHED`). It is not part of the final image's layer list: the `docker history` above contains no SDK/Maven instruction and no source code, and the sizes (231 MB / 340 MB) are those of the runtime base plus our artifact. It has no tag either, so it never appears in `docker images`. The final image only contains the files that `COPY --from=build` explicitly took from it. The stage can be built on its own for debugging with `docker build --target build -t demo-dotnet:build .`.

### Annotated multi-stage Dockerfile (`dotnet-app/Dockerfile`)

This is the file as it was at the end of Task 5. Task 6 later extends it with `ARG`, `LABEL`, a `test` stage and cache mounts, and the current version is listed in the Task 6 section.

Legend:

- **[files]**: creates a filesystem layer. **[meta]**: only changes the image config / build state.
- **[cached]** / **[rebuilt]**: what happens when only the source code (`src/DemoApi/*.cs`) changes. Verified in the rebuild measurement above.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#   ↑ Parser directive (not an instruction): use the latest stable Dockerfile frontend v1. [meta: no layer] [cached]

```

### Optional: chiseled runtime image

A temporary copy of `dotnet-app/Dockerfile` with only the final `FROM` changed to `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0-noble-chiseled` was built (not committed; the image was deleted afterwards):

```text
demo-dotnet:chiseled-exp   125MB          (vs 231 MB for aspnet:10.0)
User="1654"                               (USER $APP_UID still works; chiseled images also define APP_UID)
curl /weatherforecast → HTTP 200

$ docker exec -it <container> sh
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "sh": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown
exit=127
$ docker exec <container> /bin/bash
... exec: "/bin/bash": stat /bin/bash: no such file or directory: unknown
```

`docker exec ... sh` fails because a chiseled image contains **no shell** (and no package manager): only the runtime, the minimal libraries and the app. That is mainly a **feature**:

- An attacker who gets code execution in the app cannot open a shell, install tools with `apt` or run shell scripts.
- There are far fewer packages with CVEs.
- The image is 46 % smaller.

The downside is **debugging**: an operator cannot look around inside the container. Debugging has to happen through logs, metrics or an ephemeral debug container that shares the process namespace (for example, `docker run --pid=container:<id>` with a tool image, or `kubectl debug`).

## Task 6 – ARG, LABEL, test stage and BuildKit features

Environment: Docker Engine 28.5.1 / BuildKit v0.25.1 on WSL2, branch `task-6-buildkit-features`. Both multi-stage Dockerfiles were extended. The naive and cache variants are unchanged. Temporary edits (a failing assertion, extra Maven dependencies) were reverted from byte-exact backups (`sha256sum -c` OK). The secret experiments ran in an isolated scratch directory **outside the repository** with the fake value `demo-secret-not-real`.

### Final Dockerfiles

[`dotnet-app/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Global ARG: declared before the first FROM, so it can only be used in FROM lines.
ARG DOTNET_VERSION=10.0

############ Stage 1: build ############
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:${DOTNET_VERSION} AS build
WORKDIR /src

COPY Directory.Build.props ./
COPY src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj src/DemoApi/
# Cache mount: the NuGet download cache lives outside the image layers.
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    dotnet restore src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj

COPY src/DemoApi/ src/DemoApi/
# Declared here (not right after FROM) so that a new version does not invalidate the restore above.
ARG APP_VERSION=0.0.0
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    dotnet publish src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj \
        -c Release -o /app/publish --no-restore -p:Version=${APP_VERSION}

############ Test stage (only runs with --target test) ############
FROM build AS test
COPY tests/DemoApi.Tests/ tests/DemoApi.Tests/
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    dotnet test tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj -c Release

############ Stage 2: runtime ############
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:${DOTNET_VERSION} AS final
# ARGs are scoped to a stage: APP_VERSION must be declared again to be used here.
ARG APP_VERSION=0.0.0
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.version=${APP_VERSION} \
      org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo" \
      org.opencontainers.image.description="Demo API" \
      org.opencontainers.image.licenses="MIT"
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/publish .

EXPOSE 8080
USER $APP_UID
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DemoApi.dll"]
```

[`java-app/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/java-app/Dockerfile) received the same features:

- `ARG JAVA_VERSION=21` used in both `FROM` lines;
- a cache mount on `/root/.m2` for every `mvn` call;
- a `test` stage `FROM build AS test` + `RUN mvn -B -ntp test`;
- `ARG APP_VERSION` + the OCI labels in the final stage.

The `ARG`/`LABEL` block was placed **after** `RUN groupadd ...` for the same cache reason as in the .NET file.

**Deviation from the lab snippet (placement of `ARG APP_VERSION` in the build stage).** The lab declares `ARG APP_VERSION` right after `FROM ... AS build`. With BuildKit, every `RUN` after an `ARG` declaration receives the value as an environment variable, so a new version would also invalidate `dotnet restore`. Declaring it just before `dotnet publish` keeps the restore cached. This was verified (see 6.1). The behavior is otherwise identical.

### 6.1 Build arguments

```text
$ docker build --progress=plain --build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0 -t demo-dotnet:0.1.0 .
#13 [build 5/7] RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages     dotnet restore ...   DONE 5.2s
#15 [build 7/7] RUN --mount=type=cache,... dotnet publish ... --no-restore -p:Version=0.1.0     DONE 6.9s
#17 [final 3/3] COPY --from=build /app/publish .                                              CACHED
exit=0

$ docker image inspect demo-dotnet:0.1.0 --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}'
{
    "org.opencontainers.image.description": "Demo API",
    "org.opencontainers.image.licenses": "MIT",
    "org.opencontainers.image.source": "https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo",
    "org.opencontainers.image.version": "0.1.0"
}

$ docker run --rm --entrypoint sh demo-dotnet:0.1.0 -c 'grep -o "\"DemoApi/[^\"]*\"" DemoApi.deps.json'
"DemoApi/0.1.0"                     ← the build argument reached MSBuild (-p:Version) as well
```

The restore ran again here because it is the first build with a cache mount (a new instruction text, so a new cache key). `COPY --from` was `CACHED` because `Directory.Build.props` already sets `Version=0.1.0`, so the published files were byte-identical to the Task 5 build.

Only the version changed (`--build-arg APP_VERSION=0.2.0`, experiment image deleted afterwards):

```text
#13 [build 5/7] RUN ... dotnet restore src/DemoApi/DemoApi.csproj          CACHED     ← ARG declared after it
#14 [build 6/7] COPY src/DemoApi/ src/DemoApi/                             CACHED
#15 [build 7/7] RUN ... dotnet publish ... -p:Version=0.2.0                DONE 5.5s  ← uses the new value
#17 [final 3/3] COPY --from=build /app/publish .                           DONE 0.1s
version label: 0.2.0
```

Without `--build-arg`, the default applies: `version label: 0.0.0`.

**Why must `APP_VERSION` be declared in both stages? What happens if you forget it in `final`?**

An `ARG` is scoped to the stage in which it is declared, from the declaration to the end of that stage. A new `FROM` starts a new scope, and a global `ARG` (before the first `FROM`) is visible only in `FROM` lines. The `build` stage needs it for `-p:Version`, and the `final` stage needs it for the `LABEL`, so each stage declares it. A temporary copy without `ARG APP_VERSION` in `final` was built with `--build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0`:

```text
1 warning found (use docker --debug to expand):
 - UndefinedVar: Usage of undefined variable '$APP_VERSION' (line 32)
version label: ""
```

The build does **not** fail: it only warns. The variable expands to an empty string, so the image silently gets an empty `org.opencontainers.image.version` label. This is easy to miss, which is why it is worth checking the labels with `docker image inspect` (or `docker build --check`, which reports the same `UndefinedVar` warning).

### 6.2 Labels

The labels shown above come from the `final` stage. The Java image has the same set (`description: "Demo Spring Boot app"`). It also still carries labels **inherited from its base image**, for example `org.opencontainers.image.title: "ubuntu"` and `org.opencontainers.image.created` from the Temurin base, because labels are inherited unless they are overwritten:

```text
$ docker image inspect demo-java:multistage --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}'
{"org.opencontainers.image.created":"2026-10-25T10:26:07.538865+00:00","org.opencontainers.image.description":"Demo Spring Boot app",
 "org.opencontainers.image.licenses":"MIT","org.opencontainers.image.source":"https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo",
 "org.opencontainers.image.title":"ubuntu","org.opencontainers.image.version":"0.1.0"}
```

`org.opencontainers.image.source` points to the [`ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo) repository, which is what links the GHCR package to that repository in Task 7.

### 6.3 Test stage

**Running the test stage explicitly:**

```text
$ cd dotnet-app && docker build --progress=plain --target test -t demo-dotnet:test .
#10 [build 5/7] RUN ... dotnet restore ...                       CACHED
#13 [build 7/7] RUN ... dotnet publish ...                       CACHED
#14 [test 1/2] COPY tests/DemoApi.Tests/ tests/DemoApi.Tests/    DONE 0.1s
#15 [test 2/2] RUN ... dotnet test tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj -c Release
#15 10.80 Test run for /src/tests/DemoApi.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/DemoApi.Tests.dll (.NETCoreApp,Version=v10.0)
#15 13.49 Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:     1, Skipped:     0, Total:     1, Duration: 23 ms - DemoApi.Tests.dll (net10.0)
#15 DONE 13.6s
exit=0

$ cd java-app && docker build --progress=plain --target test -t demo-java:test .
#13 [test 1/1] RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2     mvn -B -ntp test
#13 9.533 [INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3.424 s -- in hr.demo.demo.DemoApplicationTests
#13 9.570 [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
#13 DONE 9.6s
exit=0
```

**Building the final image skips the test stage:**

```text
$ docker build --progress=plain --build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0 -t demo-dotnet:multistage .     → exit=0
$ docker build --progress=plain --build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0 -t demo-java:multistage .       → exit=0
test-stage lines in log ([test ...]): 0 and 0
```

The logs contain only `[build …]` and `[final …]` steps. BuildKit builds the dependency graph from the target backwards, and `final` depends only on `build` (through `COPY --from=build`), never on `test`. `demo-dotnet:multistage` and `demo-dotnet:0.1.0` are the same image (ID `112fb9bf0f34`).

**A failing test makes `--target test` fail.** `Assert.True(false);` was added temporarily to `UnitTest1.Test1`:

```text
$ docker build --progress=plain --target test -t demo-dotnet:test .; echo $?
#15 [test 2/2] RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages     dotnet test tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj -c Release
#15 10.35   Failed DemoApi.Tests.UnitTest1.Test1 [13 ms]
#15 10.35    Assert.True() Failure
#15 10.35 Expected: True
#15 10.35 Actual:   False
#15 10.36 Failed!  - Failed:     1, Passed:     0, Skipped:     0, Total:     1, Duration: 142 ms - DemoApi.Tests.dll (net10.0)
#15 ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c dotnet test tests/DemoApi.Tests/DemoApi.Tests.csproj -c Release" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c dotnet test ..." did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
1                                     ← echo $? (non-zero)
```

With the same failing test, `docker build -t demo-dotnet:multistage .` (no `--target`) still **succeeded** (exit 0). A pipeline therefore has to run `--target test` explicitly, or make the final stage depend on the test stage. Afterwards the test file was restored (`sha256sum -c` OK) and `--target test` passed again (exit 0). This was run in bash on WSL2, so the exit code was read with `echo $?`; from PowerShell the same check would be `wsl docker build ... ; $LASTEXITCODE`.

**Advantage and downside of running the tests inside the Docker build.**

- **Advantage:** the tests run in exactly the same pinned, reproducible environment as the build (the same SDK image, the same restored packages, Linux), on any machine and in CI, without a locally installed SDK. "Works on my machine" differences disappear, and the exit code can directly gate the pipeline.
- **Downsides:**
  - Test reports (`TestResults/*.trx`, `surefire-reports`, coverage) stay inside a build layer and need extra steps to get out, for example a separate export stage with `--output`.
  - The output appears only as build log lines.
  - The run is **slower**: the test stage has to build the test project in the container (13.6 s for one trivial .NET test, 9.6 s for Java, where the Spring test starts a whole application context).
  - Tests that need external services (databases, network) are hard to run during `docker build`.
  - When the cache is hit, the tests are **not re-run**. That is correct for identical input, but surprising.

### 6.4 BuildKit cache mounts

Both multi-stage Dockerfiles now use cache mounts (`/root/.nuget/packages` for .NET, `/root/.m2` for Java) on every step that restores, builds or tests.

**Experiment (Java).** Two variants were compared on the same context:

- **A:** the Task 5 `Dockerfile`, *without* a cache mount (a copy kept outside the repository);
- **B:** the new `Dockerfile`, *with* the cache mount.

Both were first built with the original `pom.xml` (all steps `CACHED`). Then one dependency was added to `pom.xml` and both variants were rebuilt, timed with `/usr/bin/time`. Then a second dependency was added and the measurement repeated. `pom.xml` was restored afterwards (`sha256sum -c` OK).

| Change to `pom.xml` | Variant | Wall time | `dependency:go-offline` step | `package` step |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|------------------------------|----------------|
| none (warm-up) | A, no cache mount | 3.93 s | CACHED | CACHED |
| none (warm-up) | B, cache mount | 4.28 s | CACHED | CACHED |
| + `commons-lang3` | A, no cache mount | **30.69 s** | 22.0 s | 5.2 s |
| + `commons-lang3` | B, cache mount | **19.92 s** | **5.1 s** | 10.7 s |
| + `spring-boot-starter-actuator` | A, no cache mount | **38.99 s** | 23.8 s | 11.0 s |
| + `spring-boot-starter-actuator` | B, cache mount | **24.54 s** | **11.9 s** | 7.1 s |

The `pom.xml` change is a cache miss in **both** variants: `COPY pom.xml` changes, so `dependency:go-offline` is executed again. The difference is what the step finds:

- **Without a cache mount**, the previous downloads lived in the old (now invalid) layer, so Maven starts from an empty `/root/.m2` and downloads **everything** again (22–24 s).
- **With a cache mount**, `/root/.m2` still contains everything downloaded before, so only the new artifacts are fetched (5.1 s / 11.9 s; actuator brings in more transitive dependencies such as Micrometer).

Overall, the rebuild after a dependency change was 35–37 % faster. The `package` step varied between runs in both variants (5.2–11.0 s) and does not show a consistent difference; the gain is in the dependency step.

**The cache is not part of the image.** The `build` stage of both variants (`--target build`, experiment images deleted afterwards):

```text
== variant A (no cache mount)   size=672MB
$ du -sh /root/.m2  →  96M   /root/.m2
$ docker history ... | grep mvn
20MB      RUN /bin/sh -c mvn -B -ntp package -DskipTes…
87.4MB    RUN /bin/sh -c mvn -B -ntp dependency:go-off…

== variant B (cache mount)      size=585MB
$ du -sh /root/.m2  →  /root/.m2: absent
$ docker history ... | grep mvn
20MB      RUN /bin/sh -c mvn -B -ntp package -DskipTes…
0B        RUN /bin/sh -c mvn -B -ntp dependency:go-off…     ← the download is NOT in a layer
```

BuildKit keeps the mounted directories as separate cache records (`docker system df -v` lists them as `exec.cachemount`: 18.3 MB, 77.5 MB and 88.3 MB here). They are mounted only while a `RUN` executes and never become part of any image. That is why the cache is allowed to survive a cache miss: it cannot change the image content, only how fast it is produced. If the cache is pruned, the build still works, just slower. With cache mounts, the `build` stage also got 87 MB smaller.

### 6.5 BuildKit secrets

**The leak.** A throwaway Dockerfile, built in a scratch directory outside the repository, with a fake value. The image was never pushed and was deleted afterwards:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20
ARG TOKEN=my-secret-value
RUN echo "using token" > /dev/null
```

```text
$ docker build -t leak-demo --build-arg TOKEN=demo-secret-not-real .
1 warning found (use docker --debug to expand):
 - SecretsUsedInArgOrEnv: Do not use ARG or ENV instructions for sensitive data (ARG "TOKEN") (line 2)

$ docker history --no-trunc leak-demo
CREATED BY                                                                               SIZE
RUN |1 TOKEN=demo-secret-not-real /bin/sh -c echo "using token" > /dev/null # buildkit   0B
ARG TOKEN=demo-secret-not-real                                                           0B
CMD ["/bin/sh"]                                                                          0B

$ docker save leak-demo | tar -xO | grep -a -o "TOKEN=demo-secret-not-real" | sort | uniq -c
      2 TOKEN=demo-secret-not-real
```

The value is found **twice in the image metadata**: in the `ARG` history entry and in the `RUN` entry, where BuildKit records the build arguments that were in scope (`|1 TOKEN=...`). This happens even though the `RUN` never uses the variable. Anyone who can pull the image can read it with `docker history`. BuildKit itself warns (`SecretsUsedInArgOrEnv`), but the build succeeds.

**The secret mount.**

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=demo_token \
    echo "token length: $(wc -c < /run/secrets/demo_token)"
```

```text
$ echo -n "demo-secret-not-real" > token.txt
$ docker build --secret id=demo_token,src=token.txt --progress=plain -t secret-demo .
#5 [stage-0 2/2] RUN --mount=type=secret,id=demo_token     echo "token length: $(wc -c < /run/secrets/demo_token)"
#5 0.390 token length: 20                      ← the secret was available to this RUN (20 characters)

$ docker history --no-trunc secret-demo
CREATED BY                                                                          SIZE
RUN /bin/sh -c echo "token length: $(wc -c < /run/secrets/demo_token)" # buildkit   0B
CMD ["/bin/sh"]                                                                     0B

$ docker save secret-demo | tar -xO | grep -a -c 'demo-secret-not-real'
0

$ docker run --rm secret-demo sh -c 'ls -la /run/secrets; cat /run/secrets/demo_token'
ls: /run/secrets: No such file or directory
cat: can't open '/run/secrets/demo_token': No such file or directory

$ rm token.txt
```

The secret is mounted as a file (`/run/secrets/demo_token`, in memory) **only during that one `RUN`**. It is not written to any layer, it is not in the history, it is not in the image config (0 matches in the whole `docker save` archive), it does not exist in a container, and it is not part of the cache key. `token.txt` was created only in the scratch directory, deleted right after the build, and never existed in the repository (`find ... -name token.txt` → 0). Both `leak-demo` and `secret-demo` were deleted and never pushed.

### 6.6 Optional: multi-platform builds (not executed)

```text
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE       DRIVER/ENDPOINT   STATUS    BUILDKIT   PLATFORMS
default*        docker
 \_ default      \_ default       running   v0.25.1    linux/amd64 (+3), linux/386

$ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t demo-dotnet:multi .
ERROR: failed to build: Multi-platform build is not supported for the docker driver.
Switch to a different driver, or turn on the containerd image store, and try again.
```

The only builder uses the `docker` driver with the classic image store (`overlay2`), and no QEMU `binfmt` handler for arm64 is registered on this WSL2 host. Making it work would require creating a `docker-container` builder (`docker buildx create --use`) plus emulation, or enabling the containerd image store, which means changing the local Docker setup. Since the item is optional, it was **not executed**.

**Why the .NET and Java images are portable across architectures.** Both apps compile to **platform-independent intermediate code**: .NET IL in `DemoApi.dll`, Java bytecode in `app.jar`. A runtime (the .NET CLR, the JVM) JIT-compiles it to machine code for the CPU it runs on. The same `publish/` folder or JAR runs on amd64 and arm64; only the runtime underneath must match the CPU. The official base images (`aspnet:10.0`, `eclipse-temurin:21-jre`) are multi-arch manifests that provide such a runtime for each architecture, and a multi-platform build would just copy the same app files onto each variant. A **native compiled binary** (C/C++, Go, Rust, .NET Native AOT) contains machine instructions for one instruction set (x86-64 *or* ARM64), so it must be compiled once per target architecture.

## Task 7 – Tagging, publishing and running the image

Environment: Docker Engine 28.5.1 on WSL2, branch `task-7-ghcr-publish`. The published image is `demo-dotnet` built from [`dotnet-app/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/blob/main/dotnet-app/Dockerfile) (Task 6 version) with `--build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0`, on the tree of `main` at commit `d348d1d` (the merge of the Task 6 PR).

- **Who did what:** the registry login and all `docker push` commands were run by the repository owner (PowerShell → `wsl docker ...`). Tagging, pulling and running were done in WSL2.
- **Credentials:** the token was a classic PAT with `write:packages`/`read:packages` and was never written to a file or to this report. Docker stores the credentials through the configured credential helper (`credsStore: desktop.exe` → Windows Credential Manager).

> **Published package:** <https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/pkgs/container/demo-dotnet>, public, linked to this repository through the `org.opencontainers.image.source` label.
> **Image:** `ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet`, digest of `0.1.0`: `sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3`

### 7.1 Tags and digests

```text
$ docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0 -t demo-dotnet:multistage .     # all steps CACHED → image 112fb9bf0f34
$ docker tag demo-dotnet:multistage demo-dotnet:0.1.0

```

Four tags, **one IMAGE ID**: a tag is only a name pointing to an image, and tagging copies nothing.

Tags used for the registry (namespace = GitHub user `ceciliagalvaoo`, lowercase as required):

| Image tag | Meaning here | Moves over time? |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| `0.1.0` | Exact release; matches `APP_VERSION=0.1.0` and the `org.opencontainers.image.version` label | should not (but technically can, see 7.3) |
| `0.1` | Latest patch of the 0.1 line | yes |
| `latest` | Latest release | yes |
| `sha-d348d1d` | Built from commit `d348d1d` (`git rev-parse --short HEAD` on `main`) | no |

**Image tags vs Git tags.** These are *image* tags in the registry. A *Git* tag such as `v0.1.0` would be a separate object in the Git repository, marking the commit the release was built from. No Git tag was created in this lab. The link between image and commit is carried by the `sha-d348d1d` image tag and the labels. Creating `v0.1.0` on `d348d1d` is optional and up to the repository owner.

### 7.2 Publishing to `ghcr.io`

```text
$ docker tag demo-dotnet:multistage ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:{0.1.0,0.1,latest,sha-d348d1d}   (four docker tag commands)

PS> wsl docker login ghcr.io -u ceciliagalvaoo           # token pasted at the Password: prompt

PS> wsl docker push ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:sha-d348d1d   ← repeated; verified in the registry below
```

Only the first push uploaded layers. Every further tag reused them (`Layer already exists`) and produced **the same digest**, because it is the same manifest.

**Visibility and link.** The package was created as **private**. Before changing it, an anonymous request was denied (`{"errors":[{"code":"DENIED","message":"invalid token"}]}`, manifest → HTTP 403). The owner then set it to **public** in *Package settings → Change visibility*. The settings page shows *Repository source: ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo* with `org.opencontainers.image.source = "https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo"`, so the link to the repository was created **automatically** from the label added in Task 6. The old package URL `https://github.com/users/ceciliagalvaoo/packages/container/package/demo-dotnet` now redirects (HTTP 302) to the repository's package page, which returns HTTP 200 without logging in.

**Registry state, checked anonymously** (anonymous pull token from `https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:pull`, then the Registry API, with no credentials):

```text
tags: {"name":"ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet","tags":["0.1.0","0.1","latest","sha-d348d1d"]}
0.1.0          HTTP 200  digest sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
0.1            HTTP 200  digest sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
latest         HTTP 200  digest sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
sha-d348d1d    HTTP 200  digest sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
```

**Remote manifest** (`docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0`):

```text
MediaType: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
Digest:    sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
config: sha256:112fb9bf0f34  4672 B          ← the config digest is the local IMAGE ID
8 layers, 97.2 MB compressed (the local image is 231 MB uncompressed)
```

Two different hashes describe one image. The **IMAGE ID** (`112fb9bf0f34…`) is the hash of the image *config*. The **digest** (`ddaab9e3…`) is the hash of the *manifest* (the config and the list of compressed layers) as stored in the registry. `docker pull` / `docker run ...@sha256:` use the digest.

**Delete, pull back, run:**

```text
$ docker rmi ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
Untagged: ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
0.1.0: Pulling from ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet
Digest: sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
$ curl http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast
[{"date":"2026-11-05","temperatureC":-4,"summary":"Sweltering","temperatureF":25}, ...]
HTTP 200        (process: uid=1654(app))
```

**Limitation of this check.** This is the machine that built the image. Even after removing *all* local tags of image `112fb9bf0f34` (and the image itself was gone from `docker images`), `docker pull` reported the 8 layers as `Already exists`, because the BuildKit build cache still holds them. So the pull on this host fetched the manifest and config from GHCR, but not the layer blobs. That the full image is available to others is shown by the **anonymous** Registry API checks above (public manifests and tags, HTTP 200) and by the remote manifest. A pull on a machine that never built the image would download the 97.2 MB of layers.

### 7.3 Running by digest, and overwriting a tag

```text
$ docker image inspect ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0 --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'
ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet@sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3

$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet@sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3
$ curl http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast            → HTTP 200, uid=1654(app)
container image: ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet@sha256:ddaab9e3... → sha256:112fb9bf0f34...
```

**Overwrite experiment (demo package only).** A *different* image was pushed under the existing tag `0.1.0`. It is the same app, built from the same Dockerfile with one extra label: `docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=0.1.0 --label lab.experiment=tag-overwrite-test -t demo-dotnet:overwrite-exp .`, which gives the same 8 filesystem layers, a different config and image ID `edfe6dc6cc8e`.

```text
PS> wsl docker tag demo-dotnet:overwrite-exp ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
PS> wsl docker push ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0
25ffd3b37f45: Layer already exists        (… all 8 layers: only the new config + manifest were uploaded)
0.1.0: digest: sha256:1d14cbd66c9cee20a3698be2233ddddfb674728d6e19a7883d8f25bbfefd68a0 size: 1996
```

Registry state checked anonymously, **before → after** the overwrite:

| Reference | Before | After the overwrite |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| tag `0.1.0` | `sha256:ddaab9e3…` | **`sha256:1d14cbd6…`** (pull → image `edfe6dc6cc8e`, label `lab.experiment=tag-overwrite-test`) |
| tags `0.1`, `latest`, `sha-d348d1d` | `sha256:ddaab9e3…` | `sha256:ddaab9e3…` (unchanged) |
| `@sha256:ddaab9e3…` | HTTP 200 | **still HTTP 200**: `docker run …@sha256:ddaab9e3…` → image `112fb9bf0f34`, `/weatherforecast` HTTP 200 |
| `@sha256:1d14cbd6…` | – | HTTP 200: `docker run …@sha256:1d14cbd6…` → image `edfe6dc6cc8e`, HTTP 200 |

**Restore.** The original image was pushed to `0.1.0` again (`docker tag demo-dotnet:multistage ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet:0.1.0` + push):

```text
0.1.0: digest: sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3 size: 1996
```

It got **exactly the original digest** again, because the content is identical and the digest is a pure content hash. Final state (anonymous): all four tags → `ddaab9e3…`. The experimental manifest `sha256:1d14cbd6…` still exists **untagged** as a package version (HTTP 200 by digest). The final pull + run by tag and by digest again returned `/weatherforecast` HTTP 200 as `uid=1654(app)`.

**What happened to the old image and to the digest?**

- **The old image:** it was not deleted or changed. Pushing to an existing tag only **moves the tag** to the new manifest. The old manifest stayed in the registry: still reachable by its digest, still referenced by the other tags (`0.1`, `latest`, `sha-d348d1d`), and it would have remained as an untagged package version even without them.
- **The digests:** the new image got a **new digest** (`1d14cbd6…`), because any change to the content (here only one label in the config) changes the hash. The old digest still identifies exactly the old content.
- **What this means for users:** someone who runs `0.1.0` today and tomorrow may get two different images without noticing.

**Why is running by digest safer than running by tag?** A digest is a content hash: it is **immutable** and verifiable. `image@sha256:ddaab9e3…` always resolves to exactly the same bytes, on every machine and at any time, and Docker verifies the downloaded content against it. A tag is a mutable pointer that anyone with push rights can move, by mistake or deliberately (a compromised account, a CI job that re-pushes), as just demonstrated with `0.1.0`. Pinning by digest therefore gives reproducible deployments (the image tested is the image deployed), protects against silent changes or tampering, and makes rollbacks exact. The usual compromise is to deploy by digest and keep tags for humans, or to use `name:tag@sha256:…`.

### 7.4 Running containers

```text
$ docker run -d --name demo -p 8080:8080 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development demo-dotnet:0.1.0
63be1b8a4c3e...
$ docker ps
NAMES     IMAGE               STATUS         PORTS
demo      demo-dotnet:0.1.0   Up 4 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, [::]:8080->8080/tcp
$ docker logs demo
      Now listening on: http://[::]:8080
      Hosting environment: Development           ← the -e variable reached the app
$ docker exec demo sh -c 'echo "shell inside: $(id -un) on $(hostname)"'
shell inside: app on 63be1b8a4c3e                ← works: aspnet:10.0 is Debian-based (it would fail on chiseled, see Task 5)
$ curl http://localhost:8080/weatherforecast     → HTTP 200
$ docker stop demo && docker rm demo
```

**What does `-p 8080:8080` mean?** `-p HOST:CONTAINER`. The **left** side is the port on the host, where clients such as `curl localhost:8080` connect. The **right** side is the port inside the container's network namespace, where the application must be listening. Docker forwards host:8080 → container:8080.

**What happens with `-p 9090:8081` when the app listens on 8080?**

```text
$ docker run -d --name demo-wrongport -p 9090:8081 demo-dotnet:0.1.0
$ docker ps --format '{{.Ports}}'
8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9090->8081/tcp, [::]:9090->8081/tcp
$ docker logs demo-wrongport
      Now listening on: http://[::]:8080
$ curl http://localhost:9090/weatherforecast
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer        HTTP 000, curl exit=56
$ docker exec demo-wrongport sh -c 'awk ... /proc/net/tcp6'
listening (hex port): 00000000000000000000000000000000:1F90     ← 0x1F90 = 8080
```

The container starts normally and Docker does open port 9090 on the host. However, it forwards the traffic to port **8081** inside the container, where nothing is listening, while the app listens on 8080. The connection is accepted by Docker's proxy and then reset, so the client gets no HTTP response at all. `8080/tcp` appears unpublished in `docker ps`, because it is only exposed (`EXPOSE`). The fix is to map to the port the app really uses (`-p 9090:8080`), or to make the app listen on 8081 (`-e ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8081`).

### Expected result of Task 7

- Public image: <https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/pkgs/container/demo-dotnet> (`ghcr.io/ceciliagalvaoo/demo-dotnet`).
- `docker images` with several tags of the same IMAGE ID: see 7.1 (`0.1.0`, `0.1`, `latest`, `multistage`, all `112fb9bf0f34`).
- Digest `sha256:ddaab9e34d932a26b23d2a45b1935fbc527148f0cfbb4fb0c2c48da8db5a1fc3`, with the run by digest and the answers to 7.3 and 7.4 above.

## Final repository structure

[`ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo) (public). Each task was merged through its own pull request (#1–#8 for Tasks 0–7); #9 made the report wording repository-independent.

Not committed on purpose: the build outputs (`bin/`, `obj/`, `publish/`, `target/`), the experiment Dockerfiles (Task 2 anatomy, Task 4 base-tag copies, Task 5 chiseled copy, Task 6 secret demos, all reproduced in this report), and `token.txt` (deleted).

## Final checklist (Tasks 0–7)

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 0 | Public `docker-build-demo` repository created and cloned; tools checked | ✅ Done |
| 1 | .NET and Java apps built with their native tools; build steps listed | ✅ Done (native, WSL2) |
| 2 | Task 2 questions answered (with real build observations) | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Naive Dockerfiles built and analyzed with `docker history` | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Cache behavior observed and the table filled in | ✅ Done (tag `10.0.0` does not exist; documented, tested with `10.0.403` and `10.0.100` instead) |
| 4 | `.dockerignore` files created | ✅ Done (context 15.99 MB → 4.55 kB and 20.02 MB → 23.48 kB) |
| 5 | Multi-stage Dockerfiles for .NET and Java, running as non-root | ✅ Done (uid 1654 / uid 999) |
| 5 | Image comparison table filled in with own measurements | ✅ Done (WSL2, warm cache, median of 3) |
| 5 | Annotated multi-stage Dockerfile | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Chiseled runtime image | ✅ Optional, done (125 MB, no shell) |
| 6 | `ARG`, `LABEL`, a `test` stage and a cache mount used | ✅ Done (`--target test` passes; fails with exit code 1 on a failing test) |
| 6 | Secret leak demonstrated, and a secret mount used | ✅ Done (fake value only; images never pushed, deleted) |
| 6 | Multi-platform build | ➖ Optional, not executed (docker driver does not support it; explained) |
| 7 | Image tagged, pushed to `ghcr.io`, pulled and run, also by digest | ✅ Done ([package](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/docker-build-demo/pkgs/container/demo-dotnet), public; digest `sha256:ddaab9e3…`) |
| 7 | Tag overwrite experiment (digest before/after) | ✅ Done (`ddaab9e3…` → `1d14cbd6…` → restored `ddaab9e3…`) |
| 8 | Project containerized and documented | ➖ Separate deliverable: [`hospital-devops` `docs/docker-build.md`](https://github.com/ceciliagalvaoo/hospital-devops/blob/main/docs/docker-build.md) (ceciliagalvaoo/hospital-devops#181) |
